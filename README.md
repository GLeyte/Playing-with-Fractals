# Playing with Fractals
WWDC23 Winner project

## Description

Fractal is a project that aims to teach users about fractals concepts through interactive images, where the user can see how the fractal changes through every iteration. The user is first given an explanation of what a fractal is, along with some examples and how it works. After that, the user can interact with five different types of fractals to watch how each one changes as the parameters are changed. Through the process the user is supposed to learn about fractals and have a visual idea about recursion.
